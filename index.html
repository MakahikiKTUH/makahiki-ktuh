        <h3>Welcome to Makahiki-KTUH</h3>

<p>You're reading the official page for <strong>Makahiki KTUH</strong>, home of the <strong>KTUH Pledge-a-Thon</strong>, a serious game with the two-fold goal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_building">capacity building</a> and raising funds. Not only is the game really fun: it fosters the communities of our DJs and our beloved listeners, and fulfills KTUH's stated mission.</p>

<h3>Upping Our Game</h3>

<p>The game's core purpose is to develop the individual capacities of <a href="http://ktuh.org/">KTUH’s</a> army of volunteer DJs, by providing training in the various roles that need to be filled in a college radio station. Through teaching the radio trade, encouraging collaboration, creating and managing any manner of projects, the game also provides the KTUH volunteer players with a meaningful experience, gives them freedom to act in the game as they wish, and presents opportunities to master new roles at the station. </p>

<h3>Bringing Home the Bacon</h3>

<p>Secondly—and optionally—the Pledge-a-Thon lets listeners in on the action. Through the game, it is possible merely to spectate and observe the progress being made by the volunteer-DJs. Going a step further, it is possible to sponsor individual DJs of the listener's choosing, pledging to give a fixed amount for every hour of volunteered time, or for points earned in the game. </p>

<h3>Continuing the Mission</h3>

<p>As a training system, the game fulfills a major part of KTUH’s mission, to serve the students of the university system. By involving and providing a service for the broader community (the other part of KTUH’s mission), the game fulfills the other part of KTUH's mission, as well as opportunities to raise funds for the station.</p>

<p>To learn all about the game and how it works, please check out our official wiki: (<a href="https://github.com/MakahikiKTUH/makahiki-ktuh/wiki">https://github.com/MakahikiKTUH/makahiki-ktuh/wiki</a>). </p>
