The KTUH Pledge-a-Thon® is a serious game with a two-fold goal. Firstly, it develops the individual capacities of KTUH’s army of volunteers by providing training in the various roles that need to be filled in a college radio station. 

In so doing, the game fulfills part of KTUH’s mission, to serve the students of the university system. Through teaching the radio trade, encouraging communication, and building projects, the game also provides the KTUH volunteer players with a meaningful experience, gives them freedom to act in the game as they wish, and presents opportunities to master new roles at the station. Secondly—and optionally—the Pledge-a-Thon lets listeners play, too, providing a service for the local community (the other part of KTUH’s mission) as well as opportunities to raise funds for the station.

Makahiki is a serious game framework developed by the Collaborative Software Development Laboratory at the University of Hawaii, in conjunction with the National Science Foundation.
